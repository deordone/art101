Changing Tire:

1. Gather necessary tools and materials
2. Park the vehicle in a safe and level location
3. Turn on hazard lights for safety
4. Locate the spare tire, jack, lug wrench, and wheel chocks
5. Use the lug wrench to slightly loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire
6. Place wheel chocks behind the tires to prevent rolling
7. Position the jack in a safe and stable location under the vehicle
8. Carefully raise the vehicle with the jack until the flat tire is off the ground
9. Completely remove the loosened lug nuts and the flat tire
10. Install the spare tire onto the wheel hub
